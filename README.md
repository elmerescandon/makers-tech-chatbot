# Makers Tech 🏪 - Chatbot (Haikyu!) 🚀

Makers Tech Chabot (called Haikyuu! - definetly not a reference from the anime) is an flexible, easy-to-use, and scalable API implementation for e-commerce solutions. We use the Claude 3 Haiku (Opus for testing) AI to generate entity classification and generative language. Also, our AI connects with your non-relational database, ideal for VTex or Shopify implementations. Try it out locally now or use the [front-end demo](https://github.com/elmerescandon/demo-chatbot-makers), btw this demo was deployed after the presentation!
